#Automate integrations with DevOps Services <em><span style="color: #35b2d5">BETA</span></em>

######Last modified: 2 June 2015

Time: 15 minutes 

In this tutorial, you learn how to deploy a copy of a sample app that is managed by an IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services toolchain. The toolchain is preconfigured with Sauce Labs and Slack integrations and with DevOps Services features, such as the Track &amp; Plan feature, the web integrated development environment (Web IDE), the Build &amp; Deploy pipeline, and Git for source control.

This DevOps Services toolchain integrates automated functional tests that are run on Sauce Labs into the DevOps Services pipeline. These tests can provide valuable flow control for your project as they act as gates to prevent the deployment of bad code.

The toolchain also integrates Slack messaging into the DevOps Services pipeline. For example, your team can get notifications about build and deploy activities through a Slack channel. 

**Important:** This integration capability is beta quality. After you [deploy your app](#deploy_app), you cannot modify or remove the configured integrations from the project.

## Before you begin

* To do this tutorial, you need a DevOps Services account and a Bluemix account. The accounts are free and provide access to everything you need to develop, track, plan, and deploy apps. Signing up is simple: when you sign up for DevOps Services, you can also sign up for a trial of Bluemix.

* If you don't already have a Sauce Labs account, [register for one](https://saucelabs.com/). Sauce Labs offers 14-day trials for new accounts.

* If you don't already have a Slack account, [register for one](https://slack.com/).

* Review [DevOps toolchain sample app](https://github.com/oneibmcloud/devops-tutorial-1) for guidance and a toolchain for Bluemix. The toolchain includes a Build &amp; Deploy pipeline, Sauce Labs, Git, Web IDE, and Track and Plan.

## Fork and set up the app

1. To fork the sample into DevOps Services, click the **Deploy to Bluemix** button: <a target="_blank" href="https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/oneibmcloud/devops-tutorial-2.git"><img class="button" src="images/bigButton.png" alt="Deploy to Bluemix"></a> 
2. [Log in to Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/) to start the Deploy to Bluemix flow.
3. Click **App Details**. 
4. Review the default information for the app's name and its destination, which includes the information in the **REGION**, **ORGANIZATION**, and **SPACE** fields. The values in the following image are examples for the purposes of this tutorial. When you start the Deploy to Bluemix flow, those settings are populated with a default name and with the org, region, and space that you are currently using. If needed, you can change those settings.

5. The Integrations section shows information that is specific to the Slack and Sauce Labs integrations. For information about configuring those integrations, see [Configure the Slack integration](#configure_slack) and [Configure the Sauce Labs integration](#configure_sauce_labs).

## Configure the Slack integration

**Important**: Notifications that are posted to public Slack channels are visible to everyone on the team. You are responsible for the content that you post. 

1. On the App Details page, go to the Integrations section. 
2. Expand the **SLACK** section.
3. Type the API authentication token for your Slack account. You must use a generated full-access token to authenticate with Slack. For instructions about how to find the token, see [Slack authentication](https://api.slack.com/web#authentication). 
4. Type the name of the Slack channel that you want pipeline notifications to be sent to. You can use an existing, archived, or new channel. If the specified Slack channel doesn't exist, it is created. If the specified Slack channel is currently archived, it is reactivated.

## Configure the Sauce Labs integration

1. On the App Details page, go to the Integrations section. 
2. Expand the **SAUCE LABS** section.
3. Type the user name that is associated with your Sauce Labs account. You can [find your user name in the welcome message at the top of your Sauce Labs account page](https://saucelabs.com/account).
4. Type the access key for your Sauce Labs account. You can [find this key in the lower-left corner of your Sauce Labs account page](https://saucelabs.com/account).

## Deploy your app

1. On the App Details page, click **DEPLOY**. The following steps run to set up the automated toolchain:

   a. Create the project.
   
   b. Clone the repository.
   
   c. Configure the pipeline to run.
   
   d. Configure the Sauce Labs integration to add a job to the pipeline and run tests.
   
   e. Configure the Slack integration to send notifications to the channel that you configured in Slack. These notifications indicate the progress of the deployment; for example, "Connected with Project XYZ", "Pipeline Configured", and "Stage 'build" started".
   
   f. Deploy the app to Bluemix.
